## HW 3: Simple Black Jack Game

### Project Description:
This project involves the creation of a simple Blackjack game using Python. The game simulates the classic card game where the objective is to get a hand as close to 21 as possible without going over. The project will focus on applying object-oriented programming concepts, as well as working with conditional logic, loops, and basic data structures.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Conditional Logic & Loops
- Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries)
- Randomness & Probability

### Game Rules:
- The player and the dealer (computer) are both dealt two cards.
- The player can choose to "Hit" (draw another card) or "Stay" (keep the current hand).
- The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it (busting).
- The dealer must draw cards until their hand is at least 17.
- If the player’s hand is closer to 21 than the dealer’s without going over, the player wins. Otherwise, the dealer wins.

### How to Run the Game:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `blackjack.py` file using Python 3.x:
   ```bash
   python blackjack.py
